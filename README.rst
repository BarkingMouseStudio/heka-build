Heka-build
==========

The Heka build project automatically sets up a complete Go environment with
the necessary packages installed to build/compile/test the
`heka <https://github.com/mozilla-services/heka/>`_ daemon. Instructions on
how to do so can be found in the hekad
`documentation <http://hekad.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html>`_.
